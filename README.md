SURFEX documentation

The sfxdoc project aims at gathering the SURFEX sofware scientific documentation and provide the users a technical document.\
The project is organized in 2 subdirectories, the first named "src" contains the LaTeX sources of the two main programs (surfex_scidox.tex and surfex_tecdoc.tex), the scientific documentation chapters, the technical documentation sections, as well as the bibliography and style files and a bash compilation program. The second directory named "fig" contains the illustrations. Once developers have forked the repository, they can compile the current version of the documentation by running compile_sfxdoc.bash.
